#### Definition
- It is a digital method to connect a large amount morden services or devices together

#### Category
 - PAN: Personal Area Network - network inside user's device
 - LAN: Local Area Network - network inside a building or campus which is high data transfer and low latency 
 - WAN: Wide Area Network - network connect multi LAN together, Internet is an example
 - MAN: Metropolitan Area Network - network like WAN but smaller, cover a city or large campus

#### Networking Devices
- Router: connect mutiple network and direct network traffics
- Switch: connect multiple network -> allow them to connect to others
- Modem: Convert digital data to analog signal to trander into telephone lines, cable systems and vice versa
- Access point: allow wireless connection to network using wifi or related standard

#### Protocal
- It is rule and standard which define how to is transfered in network 
- TCP/IP: tranmission control protocal - Transport layer - Chop down data into packages, then convert it back, conect to aplication by port
- HTTP: hyper text transfer protocal - define how data is formated and transmited
	- Request - Respone
	- client-server mode
	- stateless protocal: each request to server is treated as new, if dont have cookie, server dont know how client is
- HTTPS: non-symetric encrypt http
- FTP: file transmission protocal - application layer
- in internet layer, data is sent with client ip, receiver ip, package
- network layer - use mac address to detect device

#### OSI
- Application: protocal user using in browser, app - receive data form presentation layer - http
- Presentation: tranmiss or encrypt and decrypt data from network language to application language
- Session: support connection, reconnect, authenticate
- Transport: tranmiss data in netork, define how data come to then go, amount of data flow - tcp/udp
- Network: handle routing in network - tcp/ip
- Data link:
	- Mac: media access control
	- Llc: logical link control
	- collect data from physical layer then pack it to data frame
- Physical: digital device, electric devices, hardware

#### Data Transmission Methods
- Unicast: one-to-one method, data form sender just come to a receiver
- Boardcast: one-to-all method, data form sender come to all receivers
- Multicast: one-to-many method, data form sender come to many selected user

#### Network topology model
- Star: all node connect to a central node
- Ring: a node connect to 2 node
- Mesh: nodes are interconnected, multiple part between to node
- Bus: all nodes connect to a backbone
