## Define
- `Access control` is a security technique that regulates who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment
- Broken Access Control is a vulnerable that unauthorize user can access or read sensitive data
## Root Cause
- Stupid API dev - miss authenticate user
- CORS (cross origin resource sharing) misconfiguration
	- What is `CORS`: is a header set and require form API server which allows request form whitelist domain
	- What is `same-origin policy`: 
		- is a critical secury method to prevent domain attack each others
		- restrict script in on one origin access data in others origin
		- origin is a scheme define by protocol, domian, port
## Bypass
- Untrusted data is url params -> controll data return in backend
- Header POST, GET, DELETE
- Elevation of privilige
