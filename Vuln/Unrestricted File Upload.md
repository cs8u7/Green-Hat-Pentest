## Define
-   Web applications allow to upload or overwriting one or more files which are placed in folders that have executive permission.
## Root Cause
- Week Protection -> Bypass filter at upload file
- Hacker can upload executable file to server
	- Overwrite config -> executable folder
	- Web shell -> Download a virus to user devices
	- HTML -> Store XSS
## Bypass
- Missing extension can be executed
- double extension
- change a letter in extension to upper case (test.pHp)
- replace a file by there's short name (window 8.3)
- 'include()' function in php -> fetch web shell content from source, in local or attacker self host 
- weak detect malicious extension
- beating `getimagesize()` - check mine type of image 

- best file match config 
```
<FilesMatch ".+\.ph(p([3457s]|\-s)?|t|tml)$"> 
	SetHandler application/x-httpd-php 
</FileMatch>
