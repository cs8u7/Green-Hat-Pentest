#### Basic Syntax

- **`.` (Dot):** Matches any single character except newline (`\n`).
- **`^` (Caret):** Matches the start of a string. If used inside a character class (`[^...]`), it negates the class, matching anything not in the list.
- **`$` (Dollar):** Matches the end of a string or the end of a line if multiline mode is enabled.
- **`|` (Pipe):** Acts as a logical OR. Matches the pattern either on the left or the right side of the pipe.

#### Quantifiers

- **`*` (Asterisk):** Matches the preceding element zero or more times.
- **`+` (Plus):** Matches the preceding element one or more times.
- **`?` (Question Mark):** Matches the preceding element zero or one time. Also used after other quantifiers to make them non-greedy.
- **`{n}`:** Matches the preceding element exactly `n` times.
- **`{n,}`:** Matches the preceding element `n` or more times.
- **`{n,m}`:** Matches the preceding element at least `n` times, but not more than `m` times.

#### Character Classes

- **`[abc]`:** Matches any single character in the brackets.
- **`[^abc]`:** Matches any single character not in the brackets.
- **`[a-z]`:** Matches any single character in the range `a` to `z`.
- **`\d`:** Matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).
- **`\D`:** Matches any non-digit.
- **`\w`:** Matches any word character (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`).
- **`\W`:** Matches any non-word character.
- **`\s`:** Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).
- **`\S`:** Matches any non-whitespace character.

#### Special Characters

Special characters have specific meanings in regex. To match these characters literally, you need to escape them with a backslash (`\`). For example, to match a dot, you use `\.`.

#### Grouping and Capturing

- **`(abc)`:** Parentheses create a capturing group. The match can be retrieved from the resulting match object.
- **`(?:abc)`:** Non-capturing group. Groups the elements without creating a capturing group.

#### Lookahead and Lookbehind

- **`(?=abc)`:** Positive lookahead. Matches a group before (`abc`) without including it in the result.
- **`(?!abc)`:** Negative lookahead. Matches only if `abc` is not ahead.
- **`(?<=abc)`:** Positive lookbehind. Matches a group after (`abc`) without including it in the result.
- **`(?<!abc)`:** Negative lookbehind. Matches only if `abc` is not behind.

#### Flags

Regex patterns can be modified by flags to change their behavior, such as:

- **`i` (Case Insensitive):** Makes the match case-insensitive.
- **`m` (Multiline):** `^` and `$` match the start and end of each line instead of the whole string.
- **`s` (DotAll):** Allows the dot to match newline characters.
- **`g` (Global):** Finds all matches rather than stopping at the first match (note: this behavior depends on the implementation in programming languages or tools).
