- Email messages are sent and received using two types of mail servers: outgoing mail servers, or *mail transfer agents* (MTA), and incoming mail servers, or *mail delivery agents* (MDA). MTAs retrieve outgoing email messages from the sender’s mail client, then deliver them to MDAs, which are responsible for temporarily storing and delivering email messages to the recipient’s mail client.
- Mail servers deliver email messages between mail clients by using email protocols, which tell the server how to process incoming requests, where to forward the messages, and how to deliver them to the intended mail client.
- When sending an email from one client to another, the MTA uses an outgoing mail protocol, like the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), to check the sender’s email envelope* data and determine where the message needs to be sent. SMTP does this by using the Domain Name System (DNS) to translate the recipient’s domain into an IP address.
- Then, it locates a mail delivery agent by querying mail exchange (MX) records. The MX record tells the server how to route the message to its final destination. Once the MX record returns the appropriate destination, the MDA uses an incoming mail protocol, like the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3), to retrieve the email message from the mail server and deliver it to the specified mail client (or clients).
