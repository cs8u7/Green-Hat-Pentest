- Although using web crawlers similar to search engines, third-party services usually do not provide searching services, they provide extracting data services instead. Pen-testers can reveal web target applications based on endpoints that are extracted from crawlers' data. Indeed, those endpoints include domain and subdomain so pen-testers can collect domain and subdomain by handling and filtering that data. This involved developing a technique for reverse IP lookup and domain enumeration using query crawlersâ€™ services.
- In modern life, most web applications require and need a secure and private connection to communicate with other devices or services in the internet space, and HTTPS protocol is created. HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS), although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protocol uses an SSL certificate which is stored in a web server to create a secure connection or searchable database of certificate transparency logs. Certificate Transparency is an Internet security standard and open-source framework for monitoring and auditing digital certificates. When web administration wants to register SSL certificates, the administrator sends a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) which contains the domain name and other information like organization name, location, and public key to a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA). If domain owners can secure multiple domains and sub-domains with one SSL certificate, they would use the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certificate to cover all managed domains with a single SSL certificate. This encrypts processing management is the idea of technique domain discover with certificates. This technique usually has high accuracy because all the subdomain that are extracted from the certificate is added by the SSL register or the domain owners.
